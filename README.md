# Responsive Web Design - Wellness Association Practice Project

Recently I've been exploring the world of design trying to get a good grasp on basic concepts.  Along with that I'm hoping to improve my frontend knowledge and skillset in coding responsive layouts.  This is the first design I came up with which features a full screen hero layout with text overlay.  I tried making sure there was a decent contrast and that visual hierarchy was included.  I played around with fonts a little bit but a standard Arial seemed to be OK.  After development I had to make some adjustments for performance and accessibility (google hated my contrast lol) so it's not an exact match to the design but it's pretty close.
